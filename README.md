In this project, predict the open price in the daily timeframe of Apple stocks with LSTM (Long short-term memory). First, with ACF, see autocorrelation to find the best lag time. After that, create a 60-day lag and then model with LSTM. This model can predict the trend of price, but not exactly price.
